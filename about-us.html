            <p class="sample-text">We are a team of highly skilled builders and sub-contractors lead by director Brad Rogers, a qualified Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP), who has been in the building industry for over 30 years.  Our team is experienced in all areas of domestic building (Renovations, Extensions, Re-Cladding and New Architectural Builds), as well as light commercial (bar/restaurant, office, school and shop fit out).With the earthquake of 2010 and subsequent events, Rogers Building Contractors became accredited with Arrow (AMI Insurance) and Fletchers EQR, completing emergency repairs through to full remedial work under insurance and also for those who were cash settled in Christchurch.<br>

            As a family-run home-based business, we are free of sales’ people and expensive offices and we pride ourselves on being transparent. We clearly understand the risks and rewards associated with building and hence focus solely on providing  you with an excellent service and quality finish. Our company culture is such that we focus on you our client and give you the opportunity to talk directly with a qualified builder at anytime to answer any of your concerns, and also help guide you in the right direction.<br>

            Rogers Building Contractors was started when we realised that there was a void in the industry that just wasn’t being full-filled. Building companies would promise the world but seldom deliver on it, money was the main driving factor for promises that were never full-filled. Hence Brad with wife Roxanne set out to change these low standards, we realised by cutting down on all the additional fluff  we managed to keep our overheads low and manage variations with ease passing the savings onto our clients and their budget.</p>
